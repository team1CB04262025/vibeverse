Been to Serious Pie a few times over a couple of years. We did a food tour maybe a decade ago (with the pink umbrella guide) and so we discovered Tom Douglas (of Etta’s) and his famous coconut pie, and coincidentally his Serious Pie place.

The last time we were here was over 8 years ago and we ate at the smaller location next door. So we were surprised that it had expanded.

After landing from Asia, it was around 830 pm so we rushed to this place (across our hotel) for dinner and thankfully they accepted us despite them closing at 9 pm.

Pizza was good. Despite it not the gluten-free option, I didn’t bloat afterwards. We had the mozzarella pizza for our 3yo and he ate 5 slices. I recall the sausage pizza was good before, but didn’t order tonight. It was not also salty and greasy. The dough was not burnt; it was chewy which I prefer, because I dislike pizza that gets tough to eat when cold.

The faro salad though I didn’t like. It was slightly spicy (though I am Asian to I am not averse to spicy food), which I didn’t expect. Maybe because it wasn’t specified in the menu.

Service was good and fast. And they didn’t rush us to eat since we ordered around 840 pm already.

I found the place a bit dark though. The menu was hard to read.
